        What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since,
          some printer in the 1500s took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book;
           it has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting,
            essentially unchanged except for an occasional 'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled,
             it became as incomprehensible as Greek; the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!
